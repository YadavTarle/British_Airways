## Project Overview
The predictive modeling project aims to leverage data analytics to forecast customer booking patterns for British Airways. By understanding these patterns, the company can make data-driven decisions to enhance customer satisfaction and optimize flight operations.

## British Airways Data Science Job Simulation
In February 2025, I completed a simulation focusing on how data science is a critical component of British Airways' success. Key activities included:
- Scraped and analyzed customer review data to uncover findings.
- Built a predictive model to understand factors that influence buying behavior.

## Data
The project utilizes various data sources to build and train predictive models. The data includes:
- Historical booking data
- Customer demographics
- Flight schedules
- External factors (e.g., holidays, weather)

## Installation
To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YadavTarle/British_Airways.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd British_Airways
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
To run the predictive models and analyze the data, open and execute the Jupyter Notebook files provided in the repository. For example:
1. Open `task2.ipynb` using Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook task2.ipynb
   ```
2. Follow the instructions within the notebook to run the analysis and view the results.

## Results
The project provides insights into customer booking patterns, including:
- Predictive accuracy of booking trends
- Analysis of factors influencing bookings
- Visualization of booking patterns

## Contributing
